#  Weather Dashboard

A simple and elegant **Weather Dashboard** web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It allows users to search for any city and view the **current weather conditions** such as temperature, humidity, and weather description with matching icons — all in a clean, minimal UI.

##  Project Structure

```bash
weather-dashboard/
│
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # Styling for the dashboard
├── script.js           # Handles API calls and dynamic updates
└── README.md           # Project documentation
 ## Features

 Search Bar — Search any city and get instant weather updates.

 Real-time Weather Data — Displays temperature, humidity, and weather condition.

 Weather Icons — Dynamic icons update based on weather conditions.

 Modern UI — Clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface.

 Lightweight — Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

## How It Works

The user types a city name into the search bar.

The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

The data (temperature, humidity, description, and icon) updates dynamically on the dashboard.
